				The purpose of this journal is to record daily techinques, facts, algorithms, and other useful but obscure bits of information
				I encounter during the working day that will most likely need repeating at some point days (or months) later. Additionally, this
				tool also offers a great way of capturing and consolidating data and information gathered from various "google-ing" sessions as
				well as online tutorials of all kinds. It also provides a means of extracting and re-packing tips, tricks, and techniques captured from
				various computer books on programming, web development, software design, and project planinning just to name a few areas of
				personal interest and on-going study. The intent of this site to take the amassed information and after proper massaging repackage
				and display it in a meaniful way for further edification. This site will continue to evolve as I learn other techniques specific to web 
				design and development using AngularJS and BootStrap.
